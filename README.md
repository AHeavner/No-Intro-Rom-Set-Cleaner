# No-Intro-Rom-Set-Cleaner
The purpose of this script is to delete the foreign versions of roms from No Intro rom sets.
To use it, first extract the files from all of the archives in the rom set. This script 
will delete the archives at the end so do make sure to extract them first.

This script is meant to keep USA versions only! If you want to keep different versions then change the "patterns" list.
